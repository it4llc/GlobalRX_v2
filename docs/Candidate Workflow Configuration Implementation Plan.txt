Phase 1 (Database Schema and Core Structure): 4 weekso Database Developer (1)o API Developer (1)2. Phase 2 (Admin Interface Development): 7 weekso Frontend Developer (2)o UI/UX Designer (1)o Backend Developer (1)3. Phase 3 (Dynamic Form Engine): 5 weekso Frontend Developer (1)o Backend Developer (1)o Integration Specialist (1)4. Phase 4 (Testing and Optimization): 4 weekso QA Engineer (2)o Performance Engineer (1)o Full-stack Developer (1)5. Phase 5 (Documentation and Deployment): 2 weekso Technical Writer (1)o DevOps Engineer (1)o Project Manager (1)Key Dependencies1. Database Schema: Must be finalized before API development can be completed2. API Layer: Required before admin interface development3. Package and Service Integration: Dependent on existing modules4. DataRX Integration: Requires access to field definitions and validation rulesRisk Assessment and MitigationKey Risks:1. Integration Complexity:o Risk: Integration with DataRX and Package systems may be more complex than anticipatedo Mitigation: Begin with API mocks, conduct early integration testing2. Performance Issues:o Risk: Dynamic form generation may cause performance bottleneckso Mitigation: Implement performance testing early, use lazy loading and pagination3. Scope Creep:o Risk: Requirements may expand during developmento Mitigation: Implement strict change control, prioritize core functionality4. Browser Compatibility:o Risk: Complex UI may have compatibility issueso Mitigation: Implement cross-browser testing early, use standardized componentsSuccess Criteria1. Administrators can create and manage workflows with associated packages2. Dynamic form generation correctly displays fields based on service requirements3. Communication system properly sends notifications via configured channels4. Multilingual support functions correctly for all configured languages5. Performance meets established benchmarks (page load < 2s, form submission < 1s)6. All test cases pass with 90%+ coverageNext Steps1. Immediate Actions:o Finalize database schema designo Create detailed technical specificationso Establish development environment2. Long-term Planning:o Develop integration strategy with candidate portalo Plan for scalability as workflow volume increaseso Prepare training materials for administrators
